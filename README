To run the project.

1. Clone the project to your local repository.
2. Start your mySQL server and create a database call 'instawash' (tables will be created and populated by the migrations)
3. Navigate to laravelapi folder and run the following command.
   (assuming we are building the laravel project using composer)

'composer update'
'php artisan migrate'
'php artisan serve'

4. Navigate to the reactApp folder and run the following commands.

'npm install'

5. Users with different privilages will be populated in 'serviceuser' table.

PHASE 4 -> PHASE 5

In phase 4 we had the php APIs written in the .php files and calling then from the front end application.
In phase 5 we have adopted teh Laravel Framework and have used the Models, Controllers to build the APIs.
In addition we used the migration functionality of teh framework to create the tables and seed them with data.
